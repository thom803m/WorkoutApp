				<span class="interest">Interest </span>- Yoga: Our goal is to empower and teach people how to transform their bodies and minds into a simplified, fun, healthy and sustainable way.
				I understand everyone is unique so my program are customized to the individual based on their goals and preferences.
				I believe that nothing is too difficult to overcome, as long you have the passion.
				Let me show you how to make this a lifestyle and a long term solution.
				Are you ready to transform?

				<span class="background">Background:</span> I was also in your position and stuck for a very long time not knowing what to do.  
				I tried to follow generic programs and all these harch diets, taking all sorts of supplements, doing insane exercise routines.  
				At best, these yielded short term results.  
				I could never sustain them as they were too restrictive, boring or just too hard to implement. 
				When I finally figured out what the right formula was, I realized it is actually not very hard.
