            <h4><span style="font-size: large;">Health Benefits of Stretching You Probably Didn't Know</span></h4>
			<p><span class="sentence">Feb. 27, 2024 - For many, stretching is the fitness equivalent of awkward small talk. It's the opening act, the thing you tolerate because you know it will be over soon. When we talk about stretching, we usually mean static stretching.</span></p><br>
            <p>  
				Others have challenged the practice, suggesting that stretching isn't necessary at all. Some research found that a pre-workout stretch may even have bad effects, weakening muscles and hindering performance.<br><br>
                To put it plainly, no one seems terribly enthusiastic about touching their toes. That's why a 2020 study on exercise and mortality was such a head-scratcher. The study found that stretching was uniquely linked to a lower risk of all-cause mortality among American adults.<br><br>
                That's after controlling for doing other types of exercise. The finding seemed like a fluke, until a 2023 study found pretty much the same thing.<br><br>
                Among Korean adults, those who did flexibility exercise at least five times a week had a 20% lower risk of dying during the follow-up period than those who didn't stretch at all. That was slightly better than the risk reduction seen with high volumes of aerobic exercise and resistance training.<br><br>
                How can that be? It turns out, stretching is linked to several health benefits that you might not expect.
