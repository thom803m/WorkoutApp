				<span class="interest">Interest </span>- Weight lifting: I love to help men and women conquer their fears of using strength training to lose fat and become fitter.

				<span class="background">Background:</span> I began training in the 2005 when I was only 13 years old. 
				I trained with old school bodybuilders, who helped me out with my training, so they teached and guided me through my process. 
				In college I was able to manage a national nutrition shop for several years, where I spent countless of hours researching the benefits of nutritional supplements, so I could help others achieve their fitness goals through nutritional supplementation. 
				My fitness history includes almost 20 years of strength training, weight lifting, triathlons and bodybuilding.
